# ddo-build-planner

A Cross-Platform Dungeons & Dragons Online Build Planner written in Rust.

The goal of this project is to make a ddo build planner that's blazingly fast, and runs on any system. Relatively high potential of a corredsponding website-based version in the future.

## Inspiration

The idea of this builder is inspired by the amazing work of Maetrim on their [DDO Builder](https://github.com/Maetrim/DDOBuilder).
